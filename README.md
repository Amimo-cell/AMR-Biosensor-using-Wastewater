# AMR-Biosensor-using-Wastewater
Sentinel-Sewer: AI-powered simulation of CRISPR-based biosensors for real-time antimicrobial resistance detection in wastewater networks. Early warning system for public health outbreaks.
A computational simulation framework for CRISPR-based electrochemical biosensors** that detect antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in municipal wastewater. This system models city-wide IoT sensor networks to provide early warnings of AMR outbreaks 7-14 days before clinical cases appear.
Key Innovation: 
- 🔬 CRISPR-based detection of 6+ AMR genes simultaneously
- 📡 IoT sensor network simulation for city-wide deployment
- 🤖 AI-powered early warnings using epidemiological models
- 💧 Wastewater-based epidemiology – the future of public health
- How It Works (simulated)
1. Sample: Wastewater flows through microfluidic biosensor
2. Detect: CRISPR-Cas12a system targets specific AMR gene sequences
3. Transduce:Electrochemical signal quantifies gene concentration
4. Transmit: IoT network sends data to cloud dashboard
5. Alert: ML algorithms flag abnormal patterns for investigation
Why Wastewater?
- Early Warning:7-14 day lead time over clinical surveillance
- Population Coverage: One sensor monitors thousands of people
- Non-Invasive: No patient samples needed
